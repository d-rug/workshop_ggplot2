# Overview {-}

The Davis R Users' Group meets weekly on Thursdays 10-12 in the Datalab classroom. For those who can't join in person, we always include a Zoom link for the meetings. We also maintain a question-and-answer forum at [d-rug.discourse.group](https://d-rug.discourse.group).

The group home page is [d-rug.github.io](https://d-rug.discourse.group). That's where the calendar of upcoming meetings, link to sign up, and blog posts describing past meetings can be found.

You can join the email list for reminders about the weekly meetings and news about R-related events around Davis at this link (it's also on the group home page): [https://groups.google.com/d/forum/davis-rug](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/davis-rug).

## ggplot2
Today I am going to provide some instruction about generating data visualization in R with the `ggplot2` package. We will cover:

- The grammar of graphics and how it powers `ggplot2`.
- The layers that make up a `ggplot2` data visualization.
- Guidelines for good data viz.
- Examples of working with `ggplot2`.
