# Guidelines for graphics

I've attached a [PDF checklist for creating good data
visualizations](img/graphics_checklist.pdf), reated by Nick Ulle of UC
Davis Datalab. Download it and keep a copy around - it's an excellent
guide. I'm going to go over how the checklist translates into the
grammar of graphics.

## Feature types

The first item on the list is a table of options for geometries that are commonly relevant for a given kind of data - for instance, a histogram is a geometry that can be used with a single numeric feature, and a box plot can be used with one numeric and one categorical feature.


 - Does the
graphic convey important information? Don't include graphics that are
uninformative or redundant. 
 - Title? Make sure the title explains what
the graphic shows. 
 - Axis labels? Label the axes in plain language (no
variable names!). 
 - Axis units? Label the axes with units (inches,
dollars, etc). 
 - Legend? Any graphic that shows two or more categories
coded by style or color must include a legend. 
 - Appropriate scales and
limits? Make sure the scales and limits of the axes do not lead people
to incorrect conclusions. For side-by-side graphics or graphics that
viewers will compare, use identical scales and limits. 
 - No overplotting?
Scatter plots where many plot points overlap hide the actual patterns in
the data. Make the points smaller or use a two-dimensional density plot
(a smooth scatter plot) instead. 
 - No more than 5 lines? Line plots with
more than 5 lines risk becoming hard-to-read "spaghetti" plots.
Generally a line plot with more than 5 lines should be split into
multiple plots with fewer lines. If the x-axis is discrete, consider
using a heat map instead. 
 - Should it be a dot plot? Pie plots are hard
to read and bar plots don't use space efficiently (Cleveland and McGill
1990; Heer and Bostock 2010). Generally a dot plot is a better choice.
 - Print safe? Design graphics to be legible in black & white. Color is
great, but use point and line styles to distinguish groups in addition
to color. Also try to choose colors that are accessible to colorblind
people. The RColorBrewer and viridis packages can help with choosing
colors.
