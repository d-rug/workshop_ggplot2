# Introduction

`ggplot2` is an enormously popular R package that provides a way to create data visualizations through a so-called "grammar of graphics" (hence the "gg" in the name). That grammar interface may be a little bit unintuitive at first but once you grasp it, you hold enormous power to quickly craft plots. It doesn't hurt that the `ggplot2` plots look great, too.

Today I'll be teaching you the basics of `ggplot2` with a special emphasis on the grammar of graphics.
